    "# Exercise 6: Protein sequence generation with transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will delve into protein sequences, which are composed of amino acids. Understanding and predicting protein sequences is crucial in fields such as bioinformatics, drug discovery, and structural biology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative pretraining using transformer-based models has proven to be a powerful approach for natural language understanding and generation tasks. In this exercise, we will adapt this approach to the domain of protein sequences. You will learn how to build a transformer model capable of predicting the next amino acid in a protein sequence and then train it on a dataset of protein sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, the following exercise is structured as follows:\n",
    "1. Protein Sequences: load the data and explore it\n",
    "2. Masked Self-Attention: implement masked self-attention\n",
    "3. Transformer Model: build a small transformer model\n",
    "4. Training: train a transformer model on the protein sequences to do *next-token prediction* (predict the next token, or \"word\", in a sequence)\n",
    "5. Inference and Generation: use the trained model to generate new protein sequences\n",

    "First, let's import some useful libraries. Note that you will have to write code in our custom modules!"
