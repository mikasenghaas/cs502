    "# Exercise 3 - GNNs\n",
    "## Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction using Graph Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will learn how to implement and apply Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict [protein-protein interactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein%E2%80%93protein_interaction) (PPIs). GNNs have shown great potential in various biological applications, including predicting protein functions, drug discovery, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are essential to almost every process in a cell. Understanding PPIs is crucial for understanding cell physiology in normal and disease states. Furthermore, knowledge of PPIs can be used:\n",
    "* for drug development, since drugs can affect PPIs,\n",
    "* to assign roles (i.e., protein functions) to uncharacterized proteins,\n",
    "* to characterize the relationships between proteins that form multi-molecular complexes, such as the proteasome.\n",
    "\n",
    "We represent the totality of PPIs that happen in a cell, an organism or a specific biological context with a protein-protein interaction network. These networks are mathematical representations of all physical contacts between proteins in the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, current knowledge of protein-protein interaction networks is both incomplete and noisy, as PPI screening techniques are limited in how many true interactions they can detect. Furthermore, PPI screening techniques often have high false positive and negative rates. These limitations present a great opportunity for computational methods to predict protein-protein interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we are interested to take a protein-protein interaction network and use it to build a model for predicting new protein-protein interactions. We formulate this prediction task as a **link prediction problem** on unweighted and undirected networks and use a graph neural network to solve the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a sample protein-protein interaction network from [yeast *S. cerevisiae*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae), in the form of an adjacency matrix and node feature matrix. Each node represents a protein, and the goal is to predict whether two proteins interact, i.e., is there an edge between the two nodes."
